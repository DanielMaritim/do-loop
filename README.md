# do-loop

a repo demo for a do loop

The do/while statement creates a loop that executes a block of code once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

The do/while statement is used when you want to run a loop at least one time, no matter what

do {
    // execute code
} while (condition);
